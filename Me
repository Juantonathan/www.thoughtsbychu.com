<h1>Jonathan Chu</h1>
<p>Hello my name is Jonathan Chu. I am an Information Technology Freshman at Bob Jones University. I have a had wide range of jobs from sales representative of a knife company to a tennis court repair laborer. </p>
<p>I love to play basketball, soccer, and any other sport except baseball. I have never been convicted of a felony and plan to keep it that way. I love to work because it gives me something to do and makes feel like an accomplished person afterwards. Life will always keep moving so why not accomplish something on the road.</p>
